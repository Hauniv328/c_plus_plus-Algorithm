# Brute Force Algorithm
Brute Force Algorithm is `most simple way` to found some element in sequence. <br><br>

## detail about Brute Force
Because this algorithm `checks all elements in sequence`, <br><br>
The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N)`. <br><br>
Arcordingly, amount of calculation is `proportional to size of target sequence`.
